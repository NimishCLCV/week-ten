# Journal – Week 10 (Digital Public Archaeology)

**Quote from reading:**
“‘Zines are hyper-focused pieces of media that allow for free and further exploration of certain subjects.” (Fitzpatrick 2019, p. 3)

**Reflection:**
I chose this quote because it captures the freedom and creativity that stood out to me this week. 
The idea that archaeology can be communicated through flexible formats like zines or digital storytelling made me realize how different public archaeology can be from academic writing. 
Working through the photogrammetry intro also showed me how digital tools can make the past more interactive and accessible. 
Even though I struggled with getting content to appear in Pelican, working with it still showed me how even a basic static site can become a platform for sharing archaeological stories.

**Challenges and Successes:**
- A challenge was trying to get content to appear on the Pelican website. I followed the instructions but the finished site still said “This site currently has no content.”
- A success was completing the photogrammetry intro and understanding how structure-from-motion works.
- A success was seeing how different creative media can make archaeology emotional and engaging.
- A challenge was imagining what archaeology could look like when emotion, creativity, and outreach are placed at the center instead of data.

**Creative Mindset:**
- This week showed me that archaeology isn’t just analysis and that it can also be creative storytelling that makes the past more accessible.
- If I did an MA in Public History, I’d want to focus on digital storytelling tools like zines, narrative maps, or interactive sites that bring back archaeological stories to the public.

**Looking Ahead:**
Next time, I want to push myself more with the creative tools, like finishing the collections site.
