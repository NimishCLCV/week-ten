# Week 10 Memos – Digital Public Archaeology
- I read about digital storytelling approaches in archaeology and learned how emotion, creativity, and narrative can shape how the public connects with the past.
- I completed the photogrammetry intro notebook and learned the basic idea behind turning photos into 3D models through structure-from-motion.
- I explored the Pelican static site generator using the terminal, installed the required plugins, and tried generated a basic working website.

## Rough Parts / Errors
- I wasn't able to generate a website with content, I created the website following the instructions but wasn't able to add content inside of it.
- The site just kept saying This site currently has no content.

## New Terms I Encountered
- Photogrammetry
- Creative Practice
- Archaeologies of the Heart

## Key Takeaways
- Creative storytelling can change how people emotionally connect with archaeology, making the past feel more alive and meaningful.
- Tools like photogrammetry show that digital methods can make archaeology more accessible by letting people interact with 3D models.
- This week showed me that archaeology isn’t just about analyzing data and that it’s also about building experiences, emotions, and narratives that invite people into the past.

# Note to self
- Finish making a collections site.
